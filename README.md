# Circular-Linked-List
A Circular Linked List is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a  circular structure.   Unlike a traditional linked list, which ends with a null pointer, a circular linked list has no end. 
Common Operations:

Insertion:
At the beginning: Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
At the end: Insert a new node at the end of the list.
After a given node: Insert a new node after a specific node.
Deletion:
At the beginning: Delete the first node.
At the end: Delete the last node.
After a given node: Delete the node after a specific node.
Traversal: Traverse the list in a circular manner.
Applications:

Implementing Circular Buffers: Used for efficient data buffering.
Round-Robin Scheduling: Implementing a round-robin scheduling algorithm.   
Task Scheduling: Managing tasks in a cyclic order.   
By understanding the concepts and operations of a circular linked list, you can effectively use this data structure in various programming scenarios.
